              <h5>We all use the latest technology every day in our personal lives, from mobile devices, apps, online shopping and banking, to alert systems and voice recognition.</h5>
              <p class="flow-text">But healthcare has often been slow to harness these new advances and the opportunities they offer. We are changing that.</p>
              <p class="flow-text">The roll out of our new electronic patient record (EPR) will bring many benefits to our staff and patients. Replacing many of the systems we currently use, it will reduce the need for staff to access multiple applications through different log ins by introducing a single, integrated patient record.</p>
              <p class="flow-text">EPR will not just be quicker and more convenient. Crucially, having one single patient record – available to all the staff who need to access it, when and where they need it – means we can be confident care is as safe as possible for our patients.</p>
              <p class="flow-text">In addition, EPR will help us deliver our ambitions as the Royal Free London group by supporting the implementation of our Clinical Practice Group (CPG) pathways. When patients come to hospital with certain symptoms, new digital CPG pathways will prompt the healthcare team to the right course of treatment, based on the latest clinical best practice.</p>
              <p class="flow-text">The move to EPR is an exciting innovation, heralding the end of paper records over the next 12 months. As we take this next important step on our journey to become the most digitally advanced trust in the NHS, we can be proud that we are leading the way.</p>
